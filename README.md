# LeNet5-Optimizer-Performance-Analysis

This repository consists of the files for the final project for the graduate course ECE-579 Intro to Deep Learning. The project is the analysis of optimizer performance on the LeNet5 CNN architecture. 

The optimizers used were:
* Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
* Adaptive Gradient Descent (Adagrad)
* Adam 
* RMSprop

To run the project:
* Clone the repository
* Run the main python script
